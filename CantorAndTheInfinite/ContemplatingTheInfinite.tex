\maketitle

If you've never thought much about the idea of ``infinity'' before, then the Great Theorems of Chapters 11 and 12 might be a little surprising.  If you've seen them before, it's always good to stop and think a bit about why these theorems are surprising.  The historical context in the readings in Dunham should help.

For fun, you might try to explain to a (non-mathematician) friend that there are infinite sets which are the same ``size'', and infinite sets which are different ``sizes''.  You'll first have to explain what you mean by ``size'', of course!  The second reading might help your explanation, since it can be used effectively in a high school classroom for talking about this topic.
