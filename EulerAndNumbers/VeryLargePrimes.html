<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">Being one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, Euler considered many
subjects. Here, we look at Euler’s work with some of Fermat’s conjectures in number
theory. In an unusual turn of events, we consider the Great Theorem as part of the
first reading for this chapter. One of the consequences of this Great Theorem is that
people began using Euler’s proof method to look for larger and larger primes. This
was one of the first ways to look for primes other than simply considering all of their
factors. Different methods have since been invented, so Euler’s method isn’t
necessarily used anymore, but our second reading explores “records” for the largest
known primes. The article also does a nice job detailing how things changed
after the modern computer was invented! You can also click the links in the
article if you’re interested in learning more about how people search for
primes.
