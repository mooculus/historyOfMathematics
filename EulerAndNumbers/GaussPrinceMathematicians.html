<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">One of the downsides of using a textbook like Dunham’s is that we only have time to
talk about a small number of mathematicians. At this point in history, we begin to
see an increasing number of names you would recognize from your studies, both in
mathematics as well as other subjects. To put Gauss in the epilogue of a chapter
about Euler is, in my opinion, a disservice to this great mathematician. Some people
even consider him to be the greatest mathematician since antiquity - greater even
than Euler. You should, of course, form your own opinions after doing these
readings.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">We begin with Dunham’s biography of Gauss, and then our second reading discusses
Gauss’s proofs of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. You don’t need to be able to
give these proofs exactly as they are described, but you should be able to talk about
the main ideas. Finally, an optional third reading is the Mathematics Genealogy
Project, beginning with Gauss. The genealogy project has a page for most modern
mathematicians listing both their advisor as well as their advisees. So, you can click
through either forward in time or backward in time to see how mathematicians are
connected to one another!
