<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Dunham’s story ends with Cantor, but the story of mathematics certainly doesn’t.
Hopefully, as we’ve talked about the history of mathematics this semester,
you’ve seen some themes emerging. Mathematics is always growing and
changing, and the way mathematicians think about the subject is also growing
and changing. The first reading is an attempt to add to these themes. It is
written by Michael Atiyah, a famous topologist who won the Fields Medal in
1966. You don’t need to read this entire article in detail, but be sure to
read enough to get a sense of the themes that Atiyah is describing and how
they are similar to (or different from) some of the themes we have discussed
previously.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The Fields Medal is the highest award given to mathematicians, and is sometimes
referred to as the ‘‘Nobel Prize of Mathematics’’. The second reading is a bit of
history on this prize, and the third reading a list of past winners of the
prize. It’s worthwhile to note that the first woman to win the Fields Medal
was Maryam Mirzakhani, who won the prize in 2014 and passed away in
2017.
