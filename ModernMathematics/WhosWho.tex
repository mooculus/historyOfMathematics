\maketitle

You may have heard of many of the mathematicians below!  As time has marched forward, more and more mathematicians have made their mark on the subject.  So many, in fact, that we hardly have time to talk about them all!  Instead, we'll try to build a yearbook of sorts to learn a little bit about the mathematicians whose work you might use!

For each of the mathematicians below, write the years they were born and died (if applicable), and then one reason we could have studied their work.  What did they study?  What theorems are they famous for?  Why are they remembered in the mathematical community?  Who did they work with?  You'll likely have to look up much of this information online.
