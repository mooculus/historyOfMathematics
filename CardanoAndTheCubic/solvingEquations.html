Finding roots of quadratic polynomials is somewhat complex. We want to find <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
x 
]]> 
</script> such that <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> <![CDATA[ 
 ax^2 + bx + c = 0.  
]]> 
</script> I know you already know
how to do this. However, pretend for a moment that you don’t. This would be a really hard problem. We have
evidence that it took humans around 1000 years to solve this problem in generality, the first general solution
appearing in Babylon and China around 2500 years ago. With this in mind, I think this topic warrants some
attention. If you want to solve <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
ax^2 + bx + c = 0 
]]> 
</script>, a good place to start would be with an easier problem. Let’s make <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
a=1 
]]> 
</script> and try to solve <script type="math/tex; mode=display"> <![CDATA[ 
 x^2 + b x = c  
]]> 
</script>
Geometrically, you could visualize this as an <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
x \times x 
]]> 
</script> square along with a <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
b\times x 
]]> 
</script> rectangle. Make a blob for <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[ 
c 
]]> 
</script> on the other
side.

what looks like an <script type="math/tex"> <![CDATA[

<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >While the quadratic formula was discovered around 2500 years ago, cubic equations proved to be a tougher nut to
crack. A general solution to a cubic equation was not found until the 1500’s. At the time mathematicians were a
secretive and competitive bunch. Someone would solve a particular cubic equation, then challenge another
mathematician to a sort of ‘‘mathematical duel.’’ Each mathematician would give the other a list of
problems to solve by a given date. The one who solved the most problems was the winner and glory

was theirs. One of the greatest duelists was Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia (pronounced <em>Tar-tah-lee-ya</em>). Why was he so
great? He developed a general method for solving cubic equations! However, neither was he alone in this discovery
nor was he the first. As sometimes happens, the method was discovered some years earlier by another
mathematician, Scipione del Ferro. However, due to the secrecy and competitiveness, very few people knew of
Ferro’s method. Since these discoveries were independent, we’ll call the method the <em>Ferro-Tartaglia
method</em>.
