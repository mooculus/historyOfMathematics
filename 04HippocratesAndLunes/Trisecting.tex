We arrive now at our third of three problems of antiquity, the angle trisection 
problem.  Again, we will look at the origin of this problem in history, some ways 
the ancient Greeks solved it, some modern ways of solving it, and the eventual 
solution to the problem.

If you are interested in one proof that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected, 
you can see \link[Proof of the Impossibility of Trisecting an Angle with Euclidean Tools]{https://www.jstor.org/stable/2688093}.  
To see a proof for just an angle of $60^{\circ}$, here is a \link[reference]{https://mathscholar.org/2018/09/simple-proofs-the-impossibility-of-trisection/}.
