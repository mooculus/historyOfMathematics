Finding the sum of the following series is called ``The Basel Problem'' as it interested several mathematicians with connections to the city of Basel, Switzerland.  (Who were they?)
\[
1 + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{16} + \frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{36} + \frac{1}{49}\cdots
\]
Notice: we are asking for the sum of the reciprocals of the square numbers. 


\begin{question}
Consider:
\[
f(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{5!}-\frac{x^6}{7!} + \frac{x^8}{9!} - \frac{x^{10}}{11!} + \dots
\]
Can you explain why 
\[
f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x}\qquad x \ne 0?
\]
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Let $g(x)$ be a polynomial with roots $a_1,\dots, a_n$. Suppose also
that $g(0)=0$. What are the factors of $g(x)$?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Let $g(x)$ be a polynomial with roots $a_1,\dots, a_n$. Suppose also
that $g(0)=1$. What are the factors of $g(x)$?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
What exactly are the roots of $f(x)$? What is $f(0)$?  Explain why:
\[
f(x) = \bigg(1-\frac{x}{\pi} \bigg)\bigg(1-\frac{x}{-\pi} \bigg)\bigg(1-\frac{x}{2\pi} \bigg)\bigg(1-\frac{x}{-2\pi} \bigg)\bigg(1-\frac{x}{3\pi} \bigg)\bigg(1-\frac{x}{-3\pi} \bigg) \cdots
\]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why:
\[
f(x) = \prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{x^2}{n^2\pi^2} \right)
\]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why:
\[
f(x) = 1 - x^2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2\pi^2} 
+ x^4 \bigg(\cdots\bigg)  - x^6 \bigg(\cdots\bigg)  + \cdots
\]
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Explain why:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}= \frac{\pi^2}{6}.
\]
\end{question}

Compute
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^3}.
