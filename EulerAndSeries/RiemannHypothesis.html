<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">In Chapter 9, we meet perhaps the most prolific mathematician of all time: Euler.
Dunham has written a lot in his career about Euler, and so we have two chapters to
study his work. In this first chapter, our Great Theorem will investigate how Euler
succeeded where Leibniz and Bernoulli failed to find the sum of <script type="math/tex">\sum \frac {1}{n^2}</script>. Euler didn’t stop
adding up series here, though, and has an impressive list of results similar to this
one.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">Euler’s results, however, quickly bring up another question in the form of “how far
can we really go, here?” It’s natural at this point to introduce what’s known as the
Riemann hypothesis. Riemann himself, as well as the hypothesis and Euler’s work
surrounding it are all described in the second reading. The reading itself appears to
be long, but should hopefully be a quick read. Keep in mind, though, that the
mathematician who wrote it is joking about just about everything other than the
mathematics!
