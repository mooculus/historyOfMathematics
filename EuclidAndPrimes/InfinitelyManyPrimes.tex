The great theorem of this chapter is, essentially, that there are infinitely many primes.  In our readings, we'll see Euclid's proof of this fact as well as another proof by a mathematician named Hillel Furstenberg. Furstenberg is probably most famous for his contributions to an area of mathematics called ``ergodic theory'', in which we study moving systems.
