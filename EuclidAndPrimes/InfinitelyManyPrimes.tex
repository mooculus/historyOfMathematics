\title{On the Infinitude of Primes}

\maketitle



The great theorem of this chapter is, essentially, that there are infinitely many primes.  Dunham will give 
us Euclid's original proof. Our second reading is from a work called ``Proofs from THE BOOK''. You should read 
the introduction to this book to get a sense of what is meant by the title, but the idea is that a 
mathematician named Paul Erd\H{o}s thought that God kept a book of so-called perfect proofs of mathematical 
theorems. Some other mathematicians compiled proofs of various theorems that they thought could be candidates 
for ``The Book''. We'll look only at the section dedicated to the proof that there are infinitely many primes, 
but you should feel free to explore the work in relation to any other theorems that interest you.
