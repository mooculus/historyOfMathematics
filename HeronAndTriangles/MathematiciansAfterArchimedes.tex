\maketitle

Archimedes was certainly a mathematical genius, and following in his footsteps would certainly have been challenging.  Our subject now is these mathematicians, living in changing times.  It is relatively fitting to the story of mathematics that Archimedes was killed by the Romans, as the Roman takeover of much of the Greek world changed the way that people thought about and did mathematics for many years.

Here are some names of mathematicians whose contributions we will discuss at least briefly in class and in our readings.  By the end of our time on this chapter, you should be able to say a few words about what each person did.
\begin{itemize}
\item Eratosthenes (the subject of our second reading)
\item Apollonius
\item Heron (the subject of our first reading)
\item Ptolemy
\item Hypatia
\item Diophantus
\end{itemize}
