\maketitle

As we look at the Great Theorem of this chapter, one question many people have when they look at Archimedes' work is how he came to his conclusions.  In particular, Archimedes spent a lot of time estimating values that today we would usually find using a calculator.  There are a number of different ways to estimate things like $\pi$, which we talked about in the previous readings, and square roots.  In the second reading, we consider some ways that Archimedes might have arrived at his conclusions.  For the second reading, you should read at least the introduction and Section 4.
