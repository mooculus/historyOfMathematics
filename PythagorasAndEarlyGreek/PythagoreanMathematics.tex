\maketitle

Pythagoras is certainly an interesting historical character, and many people have researched his life to try to 
separate fact from fiction.  For instance, perhaps the most famous mathematical theorem is called ``The Pythagorean 
Theorem'', but scholars debate how early the theorem was known.  Perhaps it was known to the Babylonians, with 
scholars citing Plimpton 322 as evidence.  Perhaps some cases were known to the Egyptians, where legend says they 
used a 3-4-5 triangle to ensure their buildings had square corners.  Some people argue that the first known proof of 
the theorem comes from the school Pythagoras founded, while other scholars find the evidence for this claim to be 
thin.  

In this section, we will focus on the school Pythagoras founded, sometimes called the Pythagorean Society, the 
School of Pythagoras, or the Pythagorean Cult.  We will examine their beliefs, particularly concerning numbers and 
geometry, and see what came out of what was perhaps the first school of mathematics in the ancient world.
