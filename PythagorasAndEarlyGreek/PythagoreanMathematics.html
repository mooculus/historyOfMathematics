<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent">Pythagoras is certainly an interesting historical character, and many people have
researched his life to try to divine fact from fiction. For instance, perhaps the most
famous mathematical theorem is called “The Pythagorean Theorem”, but scholars
debate how early the theorem was known. Perhaps it was known to the Babylonians,
with scholars citing Plimpton 322 as evidence. Perhaps some cases were known to the
Egyptians, where legend says they used a 3-4-5 triangle to ensure their buildings had
square corners. Some people argue that the first known proof of the theorem comes
from the school Pythagoras founded, while other scholars find the evidence for this
claim to be thin.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">In this section, we will focus on the school Pythagoras founded, sometimes called the
Pythagorean Society, the School of Pythagoras, or the Pythagorean Cult. We will
examine their beliefs, particularly concerning numbers and geometry, and see what
came out of what was perhaps the first school of mathematics in the ancient
world.
