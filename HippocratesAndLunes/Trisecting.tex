We arrive now at our third of three problems of antiquity, the angle trisection problem.  Again, we will look at the origin of this problem in history, some ways the ancient Greeks solved it, some modern ways of solving it, and the eventual solution to the problem.

If you are interested in one proof that an arbitrary angle cannot be trisected, you can see \link[Proof of the Impossibility of Trisecting an Angle with Euclidean Tools]{http://www.jstor.org.proxy.lib.ohio-state.edu/stable/2688093}.  The proof we'll look at in class is essentially that of the third reading.
