As we began to see in the previous section's readings, the Babylonians could solve many different kinds of problems. 
In some ways, their methods were more advanced than the Egyptian methods.  We would like to study (or look again at) 
the ways the Babylonians approximated square roots, how they solved quadratic equations, and several different kinds 
of geometry problems.  Again, with material that is repeated in more than one place, it's good to pay attention to 
the different opinions of different authors!
