\maketitle

You may have heard of many of the mathematicians below!  As time has marched forward, 
more and more mathematicians have made their mark on the subject.  So many, in fact, 
that we hardly have time to talk about them all!  Instead, we'll try to build a yearbook 
of sorts to learn a little bit about the mathematicians whose work you might use!

Choose three of the mathematicians below and answer some of the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item When did they live? (What years?)
\item What did they study?
\item What kind of theorems did they prove?
\item Who did they work with?
\item Why could we have mentioned them in this class? (Or did we??)
\end{itemize}
Use the internet or any other resource!

After you've worked on this in your groups, please be prepared to share what you've found 
with the class.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Niels Abel
    \item Maria Agnesi
    \item Augustin-Louis Cauchy
    \item Emilie du Chatelet
    \item Abraham DeMoivre
    \item Gotthold Eisenstein
    \item Paul Erd\H{o}s
    \item Joseph Fourier
    \item \'{E}variste Galois
    \item Joseph-Louis Lagrange
    \item Adrien-Marie Legendre
    \item Grigori Perelman
    \item Henri Poincar\'{e}
    \item Srinivasa Ramanujan
    \item Karl Weierstrauss
\end{itemize}
