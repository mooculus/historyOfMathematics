<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">We will study Euclid for two chapters - the first focused on geometry and the second
focused on number theory. Euclid’s name is worth knowing because of his work
called the “Elements”, where he attempts to construct all of the mathematics
known at the time from basic assumptions he calls “common notions” and
“postulates”. By the time we are finished with this chapter, you should be
able to state Euclid’s Fifth Postulate and say something about why it was
controversial.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Two important people who influenced Euclid’s thinking are <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Eudoxus.html">Eudoxus</a>, most famous
for his “method of exhaustion”, and <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Aristotle.html">Aristotle</a> who wrote on what proof in
mathematics should be, and may have been the first to use the phrase “common
notion”.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><a id="x1-1000"></a>Readings</h3>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">First reading: Dunham Chapter 2
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent">Second Reading: <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/">Proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem</a>
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent">In the second reading, you should read the introduction, and then pick a few of these
proofs to study. You do not need to know all of the proofs on this site! You should be
able to give, in full detail, the proof from our textbook (which is also Proof #1 on the
site) as well as two other proofs of your choice.
