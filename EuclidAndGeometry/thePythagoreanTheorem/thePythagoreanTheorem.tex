\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
In this activity we will prove the most famous theorem of
  all.

\begin{question}
Remind us, what is the most famous theorem of all and what exactly
does it assert?
\end{question}


\subsection*{Euclid's proof}


\begin{question} 
What would one need to prove about the following diagram to prove the
Pythagorean Theorem?
\begin{image}
\includegraphics{EuclidAndGeometry/thePythagoreanTheorem/PythEuclid.pdf}
\end{image}
\end{question}

Let's see if we can do this!


\begin{question}
Draw a line perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$ that passes though both $C$
and $\overline{A'' B''}$. Call the intersection between this line and
$\overline{AB}$, point $E$; call the intersection point between this line
and $\overline{A''B''}$, point $E'$. Explain why $\tri ACA''$ has half the
area of rectangle $AEE'A''$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why $\tri ABA'$ has half the area of square $ACC'A'$.
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why $\tri ACA''$ is congruent to $\tri ABA'$. 
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Explain why area of square $ACC'A'$ is equal to the area of rectangle
$AEE'A''$.
\end{question}


\begin{question}
Use similar ideas to complete a proof the Pythagorean Theorem.
\end{question}


\subsection*{The converse}

\begin{question} What is the converse to the Pythagorean Theorem? Is it true? How do you prove it?
\end{question}
