\maketitle

Here are two examples of problems the Ancient Babylonians solved. For each problem, do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Follow the procedure to get the answer, check each step along the way, and check that it's the right answer!
	\item Determine what the underlying method is. Will it work for other kinds of problems?
	\item Draw some pictures to illustrate your solution method.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
The area and two thirds of the side of my square I have added and it is $0;35$. $1$, the unit, you take. Two thirds of $1$ is $0;40$: its half $0;20$ and $0;20$ you multiply by itself; $0;6,40$, you add $0;35$ to it and $0;41,40$ has $0;50$ for its square root. $0;20$ that you multiplied with itself, from $0;50$ you subtract and $0;30$ is the side of the square.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
I have multiplied length and width, obtaining the area $3,30$. I add the length and width, $29$. One follows this method. Take half of $29$, $14;30$. Square $14;30$ and get $3,30;15$. Subtract $3,30$ from $3,30;15$, you get $0;15$. The square root of $0;15$ is $0;30$. Add and subtract it from the other, you get the length $15$ and the width $14$.
\end{problem}
