<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ HEAD As we consider the Great Theorem of this chapter in our first reading,
we’ll also talk a bit more about one of the mathematicians we have mentioned a few
times this semester: Pierre de Fermat. A little of Fermat’s life story was mentioned in
the first reading from Dunham in this chapter, as well as his famous “Last Theorem”.
Our second reading does a good job of explaining the basic ideas of the theorem and
the history of its proof. Notice that Dunham’s text was published before Wiles’
proof! So, Dunham no longer correct that this is an unsolved problem in
mathematics.

to bring our story into the present. ======= As we consider the Great Theorem

     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Since  the  article  above  was  published  pretty  close  to  the  publication
     of  Wiles’  proof,  it  ends  with  some  uncertainty  about  the  proof.  That
     uncertainty has been removed - the proof has been reviewed and accepted.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Wiles has since won a number of awards for his proof. Most recently, in
     2016 he received the <a href="http://www.abelprize.no/">Abel Prize</a> in Mathematics.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Wiles originally gave the proof in about three lectures; now there are
     instances of entire courses being devoted to the matter. If you’re interested
     in seeing more details for the proof, you can read <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~boston/boston1.pdf">a very short summary</a>,
     <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~lekheng/flt/gouvea.pdf">a relatively short summary</a>, or <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/~boston/869.pdf">an entire textbook</a>. You will likely need to
     have had a significant algebra course to understand much of the proof.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat&#39;s_Last_Theorem">Wikipedia page</a> for Fermat’s Last Theorem is heavily referenced and
     also not a bad place to get general information about the theorem. (I know,
                                                                  

                                                                  
     I said you have to be careful with Wikipedia! Be sure to double-check the
     information in a non-open-source location.)</li></ul>
