<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">In the late 1500s and early 1600s, astronomy was really taking off. (Kepler, for
instance, lived from 1571 - 1630.) The more accurate astronomy became, the more
mathematicians needed to do computations with ever-larger numbers. The invention
of the logarithm (published in 1614 and 1619) by John Napier, with assistance from
Henry Briggs, was designed to shorten these calculations. In Napierâ€™s own
words:
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">Seeing there is nothing (right well-beloved Students of the Mathematics) that is so
troublesome to mathematical practice, nor that doth more molest and hinder
calculators, than the multiplications, divisions, square and cubical extractions of great
numbers, which besides the tedious expense of time are for the most part subject to
many slippery errors, I began therefore to consider in my mind by what certain
and ready art I might remove those hindrances. And having thought upon
many things to this purpose, I found at length some excellent brief rules
to be treated of (perhaps) hereafter. But amongst all, none more profitable
than this which together with the hard and tedious multiplications, divisions,
and extractions of roots, doth also cast away from the work itself even the
very numbers themselves that are to be multiplied, divided and resolved into
roots, and putteth other numbers in their place which perform as much as
they can do, only by addition and subtraction, division by two or division by
three.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Our second reading is a video explaining some ways we know to speed up
multiplication, including the use of a logarithm. These methods are an important
backdrop to our first reading, which is about the life and mathematics of Isaac
Newton.
