Activities for a History of Mathematics course.

This is the course packet that will be associated with Math 4504 starting in Spring 2018.

The packet includes reading guides linking to external websites and library resources as well as in-class activities.
Most of the ``textbook readings'' will come from Journey through Genius by William Dunham.  Each section should take approximately two class periods to cover with the exception of ``Hippocrates and Lunes'', which should take three periods.
